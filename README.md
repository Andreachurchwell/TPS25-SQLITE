# SQL Lesson: Exploring a Dataset

This lesson walks students through how to explore a simplified database using basic to intermediate SQL techniques, including `SELECT`, `DISTINCT`, `ORDER BY`, `WHERE`, `JOIN`, and aggregation functions like `COUNT`, `STRING_AGG`, and `CONCAT`.

---

## Lesson Goals
- Query and filter rows using `SELECT`, `WHERE`, and `IN`
- Sort results with `ORDER BY`
- Perform string and pattern matching with `LIKE`
- Use aggregation functions like `COUNT`, `CONCAT`, and `STRING_AGG`
- Perform `JOIN`s across multiple tables

## Tables Overview

| Table Name       | Description                                      |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `demographics`   | One row per person in the dataset                |
| `legalall`       | One row per legal event ‚Äî a person may have many|
| `programming`    | One row per person referred to programming       |
| `programmingLU`  | One row per program, with details                |

---

## üìú Database Tables

```sql

SELECT * FROM demographics;     -- 1 row for every person in the dataset
SELECT * FROM legalall;         -- 1 row for every legal event (a person may have many)
SELECT * FROM programming;      -- 1 row per person referred to programming
SELECT * FROM programmingLU;    -- 1 row per program
```

---

## üìñ Viewing Tables

```sql
-- Format for viewing any table:
SELECT * FROM <table name>;
-- * = all columns
```

---

## üîé Exploring the `demographics` Table

```sql
SELECT * FROM demographics;
```

### SELECT vs SELECT DISTINCT

```sql
SELECT zipcode FROM demographics;            -- lists every zipcode (including duplicates)
SELECT DISTINCT zipcode FROM demographics;   -- lists every unique zipcode
```

```sql
--
SELECT DISTINCT language FROM demographics;
```

```sql
--
SELECT name FROM demographics;
```

```sql
-- What if we select more than one thing?
SELECT DISTINCT language, zipcode FROM demographics;
```

```sql
--
SELECT DISTINCT race, gender FROM demographics;
```

---

## üîΩ Sorting with ORDER BY

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT language, zipcode FROM demographics
ORDER BY zipcode;
-- Notice how ORDER BY improves readability
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM demographics;                  -- 1 row per person
SELECT * FROM legalall;                      -- 1 row per case
```

```sql
--
SELECT * FROM legalall ORDER BY topcharge;
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM legalall ORDER BY topcharge, courtdate;
```

```sql
--
SELECT * FROM demographics ORDER BY age;
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM demographics ORDER BY age DESC;
SELECT * FROM demographics ORDER BY age ASC;
```

```sql
--
SELECT * FROM demographics ORDER BY name ASC;
```

---

## üåü WHERE, IN, and Wildcard Searches

```sql
SELECT * FROM demographics WHERE race = 'Asian';
SELECT * FROM demographics WHERE age = 40;
```

```sql
-- Ranges for numbers and dates
SELECT * FROM demographics WHERE age < 40 AND age > 20;
```

```sql
-- Groups of items
SELECT * FROM demographics WHERE zipcode IN (62703, 62701);
SELECT * FROM demographics WHERE zipcode = 62703 OR zipcode = 62701;
```

```sql
-- More complex logic
SELECT * FROM demographics
WHERE zipcode = 62703 OR (zipcode = 62701 AND age < 30);
```

```sql
--
SELECT * FROM demographics
WHERE (language = 'Spanish' AND zipcode = 62703)
   OR (language = 'English' AND zipcode = 62701);
```

---

## üß™ LIKE and Pattern Matching

```sql
SELECT * FROM demographics WHERE name LIKE 'Ma%';
SELECT * FROM demographics WHERE name = 'Ma%';         -- This won‚Äôt work
SELECT * FROM demographics WHERE name LIKE '%Ma%';
SELECT * FROM demographics WHERE name LIKE '%Simpson';
```

---

## üéÆ Student Practice Challenges

```sql
-- 1: Find the name of the person who has an 's' in their name,
-- speaks English, is over 60, and lives in 62704
SELECT * FROM demographics
WHERE name LIKE '%s%' AND language = 'English' AND age > 60 AND zipcode = 62704;
```

```sql
-- 2: How many people speak Hindi?
SELECT * FROM demographics WHERE language = 'Hindi';
```

```sql
-- 3: View all males over 18, sorted Z ‚Üí A by name
SELECT * FROM demographics
WHERE gender = 'Male' AND age > 18
ORDER BY name DESC;
```

---

## üí≤ COUNT, CONCAT, and Aliases

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT personid) FROM demographics;
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT personid) FROM legalall;
```

```sql
-- AS renames columns
SELECT name AS "Full Name", age AS "Age in Years" FROM demographics;

-- CONCAT joins values in a row
SELECT name, age, CONCAT(name, age) AS nameandage FROM demographics;
SELECT name, age, CONCAT(name, ' ', age) AS nameandage FROM demographics;
```

```sql
--
SELECT CONCAT(name, ',', zipcode) AS nameandzip FROM demographics;
```

---

## ü•ù STRING_AGG Across Rows

```sql
SELECT * FROM legalall;

-- Topcharges grouped by person
SELECT personid, STRING_AGG(topcharge, ', ') AS personidandcharge
FROM legalall
GROUP BY personid;
```

```sql
--
SELECT personid, STRING_AGG(DISTINCT topcharge, ', ') AS personidandcharge
FROM legalall
GROUP BY personid;
```

---

## üîó JOINs

```sql
SELECT * FROM programming;
SELECT * FROM programmingLU;
```

```sql
--
SELECT * FROM programming p
JOIN programmingLU l ON p.programluid = l.programluid;
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM legalall;
--
SELECT * FROM demographics;
```

```sql
--
SELECT * FROM legalall l
JOIN demographics d ON l.personid = d.personid;
```

```sql
-- We want all of legalall and just name/age from demographics
SELECT l.*, d.name, d.age
FROM legalall l
JOIN demographics d ON l.personid = d.personid;
```

```sql
--
SELECT * FROM demographics d
JOIN programming p ON d.personid = p.personid;
```

```sql
-- LEFT JOIN to keep all people, even those not in programming
SELECT * FROM demographics d
LEFT JOIN programming p ON d.personid = p.personid;
```

## ‚úÖ Summary

You've just walked through a realistic dataset structure using SQL: exploring tables, filtering, joining, and aggregating. Next steps could include saving your queries, exploring outer joins, or writing reusable views.
